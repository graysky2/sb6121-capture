## What is it and why?
This very trivial script will log the downstream/upstream power levels as well as the SNR from your Arris SB6121 modem to individual csv values suitable for graphing.

Use it to monitor power levels and SNRs over time to aid in troubleshooting connectivity with your ISP. The script is easily called from a cronjob at some appropriate interval (hourly for example). It is recommended that users simply call the script via a cronjob at the desired interval. Perhaps twice per hour is enough resolution.

## Example data
Here is a small data set generated by a repeat call to the script via a cronjob triggered once every 4 hours:
```

## Notes
Note that the crude coreutils lines work fine on an Arris SB6121 running
